# Related By Taxonomy

A Statamic addon that returns related entries using common taxonomy terms (tags).

## Features

Very basic for now. 

## How to Install

Will have to look into that. Never done a composer package... yet. 

But, most likely it will look like this:

``` bash
composer require niktwenty3/related-by-taxonomy
```

## How to Use

Coming soon.
